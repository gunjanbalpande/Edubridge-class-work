Statement:
A class has an integer data member 'i' and a method named 'printNum' to print thevalue of 'i'. Its subclass also has an integer data member 'j' and a method named 'printNum' 
to print the value of 'j'. Make an object of the subclass and use it to assign a value to 'i' and to 'j'. Now call the method 'printNum' by this object.


Code:
class I{
  int i;
  public void printNum(){
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}

class J extends I{
  int j;
  public void printNum(){
    System.out.println(j);
  }
}

class Ans{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    J a = new J();
    a.i = 5;
    a.j = 7;
    a.j = a.i;
    a.printNum();
  }
}
